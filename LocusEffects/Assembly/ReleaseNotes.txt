Added: Component toolbox bitmap
Fixed: Major Performance boost - 
	* DIBSection is used as back bitmap is instead of a regular Bitmap. This provides much better performance and allows future enhancements (filters, etc.).
	* Variable back bitmap size logic is used instead of a big static back bitmap
Fixed: Behavior - animations are smoother, thread sleep is now calculated dynamically. 
       Animation thread pump is now using FramesPerSecond logic and allows a variable sleep time.
