# Locus Effects

.NET/C# visual effects framework for changing the user's locus of attention to an area on the screen.

I was first introduced to the term "Locus" almost an year ago, when I attended a fascinating 2-day seminar with Prof. Jim Coplien on the subject of “Humane User Interfaces”. It was quite amazing to know that the design of user interfaces in software really hasn’t got that much attention and has a long way to go. Anyway, one of the key aspects in designing a good user interface is to understand how the human perception works. First of all, we humans have only one conscious (well, perhaps except for some lunatics ;)). In our mind, the thing that gets high conscious attention or most of our conscious attention is called the "Locus of attention".

Locus - Latin for "the place."
